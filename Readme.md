## Gameplay
The game you'll be playing will be started after you chose a hero. You can also choose to join a clan, and start fighting in clanwars. You can do this by playing a Tetris game against a member of another clan. To join a clan however, you'll need a faction. Every clan depends on a faction, so choose a faction wisely.<br/>
When you start playing, after a while there will be the first event, which is called Tornado, it will take your blocks and throw them over the field at random. When enough blocks have fallen, the second event will be triggered, this event is called Ability Reset, it will reset all you ability scores to zero. Make sure that you use your abilities in time before they are gone. When your ability bars are full, you can use one of the 2, once you use an ability, the ability score will be reseted. Choose the right ability at the right moment.
